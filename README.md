# book-search-refactor
## Description
This project's goal was to refactor a fully functional, user personalized book search engine. The book search engine originally utilized React,Mongoose, and REST APIs to fetch, display, and manipulate data. My task was to implement GraphQL and Apollo Server for querying and mutating data. To do this, I had to integrate Apollo Server, Express Middleware, and Apollo Client. I utilized the preexisting code in the controllers of the application to create queries, mutations, typeDefs, and resolvers that accomplish the same functionality. Furthermore, I integrated JSON Web Tokens to enhance the authorization features the application utilizes to manage a user's personal account.
